The steps we need to follow (as of 3rd July):
<ol>
  <li>Decide on a GAN implementation to be followed.</li>
  <li>Gather a (really) simple dataset.</li>
  <li>Decide the deadline for the completion of this tutorial.</li>
</ol>

To get started you can go through this ConditionalGAN implementation on FashionMNIST https://www.kaggle.com/arturlacerda/pytorch-conditional-gan#Results
